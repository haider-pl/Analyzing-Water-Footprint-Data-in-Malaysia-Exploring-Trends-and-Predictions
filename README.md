# Analyzing-Water-Footprint-Data-in-Malaysia-Exploring-Trends-and-Predictions
This project involves analyzing ten datasets from various water treatment companies in Malaysia, focusing on gray and blue water footprints. By conducting exploratory data analysis, insights will be extracted to understand the impact of human activities and production processes on water scarcity and pollution. Machine learning models will then be developed to forecast future trends in gray and blue water consumption, aiding in proactive decision-making for sustainable water management.
